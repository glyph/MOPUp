Features
--------

MOPUp is the mac**O**S **P**ython.org **Updater**.

If you prefer to use the binary installers from python.org, it's easy to forget
to update them.  This is a program that does that; it updates them.  Just ``pip
install mopup`` into a virtualenv using the Python you are using, run ``mopup``
and provide your password when required.

Normally, it does this using a CLI in the background, but if you'd prefer, you
can run it with ``--interactive`` for it to launch the usual macOS GUI
Installer app.
